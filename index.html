            <h3>Why Vancouver?</h3>
            <h2>One of the most beautiful cities in the world</h2>
            <p>
              Vancouver, a bustling west coast seaport in British Columbia, is
              among Canada’s densest, most ethnically diverse cities. A popular
              filming location, it is surrounded by mountains, and also has
              thriving art, theatre and music scenes. Vancouver Art Gallery is
              known for its works by regional artists, while the Museum of
              Anthropology houses preeminent First Nations collections.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Located on a peninsula, Vancouver is surrounded by majestic
              mountains and sparkling water, along with glorious rainforests,
              providing an incredible contrast to the modern skyscrapers of the
              city itself. The vistas of its leafy parks with the waterfront
              walkway, make for endless photograph opportunities and inspiring
              scenery to soak in as you enjoy the city.
